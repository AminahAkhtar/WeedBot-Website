					<h2>Biography</h2>
				</div>
				<p>Andreas Dengel is Professor at the Department of Computer Science at TU Kaiserslautern and Executive
					Director of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) in Kaiserslautern, Head of
					the <a href=""
						target="newTab" class="Link">Smart Data and Knowldege Services</a> research area at DFKI and of
					the DFKI Deep Learning Competence Center. His research focuses on machine learning, pattern
					recognition, quantified learning, data mining, semantic technologies and document analysis.</p>

				<b>Career </b>
				<p>Andreas studied computer science with a minor in economics at the Technical University of
					Kaiserslautern from 1980 to 1986. He completed his doctorate in computer science at the University
					of Stuttgart in 1989. After working at IBM, Siemens as well as a guest research stay at Xerox PARC
					in Palo Alto, he was appointed to a professorship for the Chair of <a
						href="" target="newTab" class="Link">Artificial
						Intelligence</a> at the Technical University of Kaiserslautern in 1993. At the same time, he
					became scientific director at DFKI and took over the management of a research area that is now
					called "Smart Data &amp; Knowledge Services". Since 2009, he has held another professorship
					(kyakuin) in the Department of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems at <a
						href="" target="newTab" class="Link">Osaka
						Metropolitan University</a> with teaching and examination rights. At this university, he was
					also named "Distinguished Honorary Professor" (tokubetu eiyo kyoju) in March 2018, a distinction
					received by only five researchers within 135 years. </p>

				<b>Science - Projects</b>

				<p>Andreas has chaired numerous international conferences and serves on the editorial boards of
					international journals and book series. He has written or edited 14 books and is the author of more
					than 600 peer-reviewed scientific publications, many of which have received Best Paper Awards. To
					date, he has supervised more than 500 doctoral, master's, and bachelor's theses. In addition to a
					number of keynote lectures at international meetings and conferences, Andreas has given invited
					technical presentations at numerous prestigious universities and research institutions. These
					include MIT, Stanford University, PARC, UC Berkeley, CMU, London School of Economics, Cambridge
					University, ATR, NII, Tokyo University, Chinese Academy of Science, and Google Research or MS
					Research. Also activities as a lecturer, e.g., in the Joint Executive MBA Program at Johannes
					Gutenberg University in Mainz, the University of Texas in Austin and Dongbei University of Finance
					and Economics in Dalian, China, are part of Andreas' previous activities. Four years ago, Andreas
					founded the graduate school MIND at the Department of Computer Science. Here, about 20 students are
					funded by scholarships from the industry. Furthermore, he promotes numerous exchange cooperations
					with international institutes or universities. These include, for example, exchange programs with
					NICT, NAIST, AIST and the Nakatani Foundation. The joint-credit master's programs in artificial
					intelligence he initiated with Kyushu University and Osaka Metropolitan University, which have been
					in place for more than 10 years, have also led to many reciprocal research visits by students over
					the years. </p>
