					<h2>Biography</h2>
				</div>
				<!-- <p>Andreas Dengel is Professor at the Department of Computer Science at TU Kaiserslautern and Executive
					Director of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) in Kaiserslautern, Head of
					the <a href=""
						target="newTab" class="Link">Smart Data and Knowldege Services</a> research area at DFKI and of
					the DFKI Deep Learning Competence Center. His research focuses on machine learning, pattern
					recognition, quantified learning, data mining, semantic technologies and document analysis.</p> -->
					<p>Sundus Fatima has been actively helping <a href="https://smartcitylab.neduet.edu.pk/"
						target="newTab" class="Link">SmartCity Lab</a> in expanding its technological capabilities with keen insight and creative ideas. She has over six years of experience & expertise in artificial intelligence, machine learning, embedded systems, application development, and automation technologies. Sundus is currently a Team head, leading a team of 25+ scientists and developers at the research center. </p>

				<b>Career </b>
				<p>She has been actively involved in bridging the gap between academia and industries by applying research ideas to practical problems. In line with that, she is responsible for overseeing new expansions of technology in the health, agriculture, environmental, and social sectors. She has worked closely with leading research institutes locally and around the world to conduct research and innovation in a highly dynamic environment for the benefit of the society. She has earned her Bachelor's degree in Computer and Information Systems from Sir Syed University of Engineering & Technology. Masters in the same field from NED University of Engineering & Technology</p>

				<b>Funded Projects</b>

				<p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Autonomous weeding robot:</b> She was successful in securing DAAD funding for the development of an autonomous laser-based weed-killing robot through the German-Pakistani Research Collaboration Program. The robot was created in close collaboration with the DFKI, the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence. She oversaw the design and development of weedbot by leading the mechanical design team and a team of AI engineers working on intelligent weed detection systems.
				        </li>
						<li><b> Rice Quality Analyzer:</b> She was actively involved in the development of a rice quality analyzer, another DAAD-funded project. The project uses artificial intelligence to identify and distinguish high-quality rice grains, making an otherwise difficult task easier for workers. This project was carried out in collaboration with Abu Dhabi University's College of Engineering.
				        </li>
						<li><b>Reverse vending machine (RVM): </b>  She led the development of Smart reverse vending machine (RVM), which is a great initiative under the 3R concept (reduce, reuse and recycle). The advanced and updated features of the e-bin, such as the provision of incentives when inserting a plastic bottle, will encourage users to use it instead of dumping in the conventional bins.

				        </li>
						<li><b>Prediction of user engagement on social media platforms using machine learning and deep learning:</b>She collaborated with Aga Khan University Hospital to develop a system that can help provide healthier workspaces for employees. In the development of the system she was closely involved in enhancing deep-learning systems and associated algorithms for better natural language processing. 


				        </li>
						<li><b>Development of a machine learning model to assess the risk factors and postoperative day for superficial VS deep/organ space surgical site infections: </b> She worked on another project in collaboration with Agha Khan university hospital for  the development of ML models to predict the type of surgical site infections (SSI) and the postoperative weak changes in tissues. The system also compares the risk variables for superficial and deep SSI after a variety of surgical operations. 

				        </li>
						<li><b>Enhanced radiological diagnosis of cerebral tuberculosis using machine learning:</b> She worked in collaboration with medical professionals from Agha Khan University Hospitals on the development of an AI predictive scoring system for diagnosis, treatment, and classification of cerebral tuberculosis. The technique was created as an effective means of diagnosing and treating cerebral TB, a rare and difficult to diagnose condition.

				        </li>
						<li><b>Lightweight segmentation for ADAS on resource constraint devices: </b>  Having a keen interest in computer vision, she worked with the start up company 4pilot, based in Germany, to build a successful monitoring and assistance software for road analysis using a smartphone. She was involved in the design and construction of a light-weight Deep Learning model (DNN) that can run on devices with low processing power and provide accurate real-time results.  The segmentation model helps with the perception of the algorithm and road lanes, obstacles, and drivable area.

				        </li>
						<li><b>Automated extraction of fetal Doppler velocity waveforms:</b>  In close collaboration with Aga Khan University Hospital, she has worked on the development of a system for the automatic extraction of fetal velocity waveforms using image processing. DICOM is the international standard to transmit, store, retrieve, print, process, and display medical imaging information. Using dicom files she used spectral ultrasound images to extract velocity waveforms for further analysis and computation. 
                        </li>
						<li><b>Carla: </b>  She also performed few case studies on the CARLA simulator to understand the behaviour of self-driving cars for real-time implementations.

				        </li>
						<li><b>WSN for water resource management:</b>  She worked on another project in collaboration with Prof. Andreas Dengel's research group in DFKI, on Smart Data and Knowledge Services. The developed system provides farmers with predictive insights on the ideal watering schedule for their crops based on the seasons, soil type.
